This project has been renamed to webdfs.

http://code.google.com/p/webdfs/

The reason for the change is that some friends of mine have been griping at me about calling it phpdfs when the project has nothing to do with php other than being written in php.  even though perlbal gets a pass with them.  go figure  :P.

Another reason for the change is that I can see this project being implemented in other languages in the future so PHPDFS was going to get stale at some point.
